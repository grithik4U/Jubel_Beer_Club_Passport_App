# Jubel_Beer_Club_Passport_App
The Jubel Beer Club Passport is a digital companion for craft beer enthusiasts that gamifies the experience of discovering and enjoying craft beers.

Here's what the app does:

Core Features
Digital Beer Passport: Tracks your journey through different craft beer venues and varieties with a personalized passport.
Check-In System: Allows users to "check in" when they visit participating pubs, breweries, and beer venues, recording their visit in their digital passport.
Badge Collection: Users earn achievement badges for different milestones:
Visiting specific numbers of venues (like "Brew Explorer" for 5 different venues)
Completing certain numbers of check-ins (like "First Sip" for your first check-in)
Special achievements (like "Weekend Warrior" for weekend visits)
Rewards Program: When users unlock badges, they receive special rewards like:
Discount codes for their next purchase
Free brewery tours
Special tasting flights
2-for-1 offers
Leaderboard: Compares your progress against other beer enthusiasts both locally and nationally, adding a competitive element.
User Experience
The app has a tab-based interface with four main sections:

Passport: Shows your check-in history and nearby venues
Badges: Displays earned badges and progress toward new ones
Leaderboard: Ranks users by their badge collections
Rewards: Lists available rewards from unlocked badges
The demo account ("Oliver Pint") has already collected 12 check-ins across 5 London venues and unlocked 4 badges with corresponding rewards.

The application is designed to enhance the social aspect of beer drinking while encouraging exploration of new venues and varieties, creating an engaging community around the Jubel beer brand.
